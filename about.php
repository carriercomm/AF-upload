<h1>About Allyforce</h1>

<h2>What is <span>Allyforce?</span></h2>
Allyforce is <strong>The Ultimate Personal Sales Referral Network:</strong> the easiest way to selectively exchange
contacts and account information with your partner reps to find sales opportunities faster

<h2>What is the <span>Big Idea?</span></h2>
It's an Old Idea, that sales reps in your territory know better contacts and account information
than any available directory.  Exchanges between non-competing reps is win-win for all parties,
including the prospects!

<h2>What is the <span>Big Benefit?</span></h2>
<ul>
	<li>Faster time to meetings</li>
	<li>Better, more accurate contact information</li>
	<li>Inside scoop on account, such as installs, politics, and buying cycles</li>
	<li>Monetize all prospect relationships, not just those that buy today</li>
</ul>

<h2>What is the <span>Big Promise?</span></h2>
<p>By making the exchange of information around accounts and contacts as easy as using Facebook but
designed for the professional needs and security of a sales rep as Salesforce.com, Allyforce allows you to
grow your sales by truly leveraging partners and allies.</p>
